## Model Descriptions

### 1. Find S Algorithm
![ML](https://github.com/Arya920/Different-ML-Models/blob/master/12.%20Images/Find%20S%20algo.jpg)
The Find-S algorithm is a supervised learning algorithm used to find the most specific hypothesis that fits positive training examples. It generalizes the hypothesis by updating attribute-value pairs based on positive instances. It's suitable for simple concepts with binary-valued attributes.


### 2. Candidate Elimination Method
![ML](https://github.com/Arya920/Different-ML-Models/blob/master/12.%20Images/CandidateElimnation.JPG)
The Candidate Elimination algorithm is a supervised learning method used for concept learning. It maintains two sets of hypotheses (most general and most specific) and iteratively refines them based on observed training examples to find the concept that fits the data. It can handle both positive and negative examples and is useful for learning complex concepts and handling noisy data.



### 3. Decision Tree Classifier on Titanic DataSet
![ML](https://github.com/Arya920/Different-ML-Models/blob/master/12.%20Images/DT.png)
1. Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, convert categorical variables to numerical form.

2. Feature Selection: Choose relevant features.

3. Split Data: Divide the dataset into training and testing sets.

4. Build Decision Tree: Create and train the Decision Tree Classifier.

5. Model Evaluation: Assess the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

6. Visualization (Optional): Optionally, visualize the decision tree.

7. Predictions: Use the trained model to predict survival for new passengers.

### 4. Simple & Multiple Linear Regression
![ML](https://github.com/Arya920/Different-ML-Models/blob/master/12.%20Images/ML.jpg)
Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to make more accurate predictions. It's used for tasks involving large datasets and high-dimensional feature spaces.

### 5. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
KNN is a simple and intuitive classification algorithm. It assigns a class label to a data point based on the majority class labels of its K nearest neighbors in the feature space.

### 6. Decision Trees
Decision Trees are a widely used algorithm for classification and regression tasks. They partition the data into subsets based on the values of features, leading to a tree-like structure.

### 7. Naive Bayes Classifier
Naive Bayes is a probabilistic classification algorithm based on Bayes' theorem. It's simple, efficient, and performs well in text classification and sentiment analysis tasks.

### 9. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
PCA is a dimensionality reduction technique used to transform high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional space while preserving important information.
