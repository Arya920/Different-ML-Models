### 2. Logistic Regression
Logistic Regression is a classification algorithm used when the target variable is binary. It estimates the probability that an instance belongs to a particular class. It's widely used in spam detection, disease prediction, etc.

### 3. Support Vector Machines (SVM)
SVM is a powerful algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. It finds the best hyperplane that separates different classes in the data.

### 4. Random Forest
Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to make more accurate predictions. It's used for tasks involving large datasets and high-dimensional feature spaces.

### 5. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
KNN is a simple and intuitive classification algorithm. It assigns a class label to a data point based on the majority class labels of its K nearest neighbors in the feature space.

### 6. Decision Trees
Decision Trees are a widely used algorithm for classification and regression tasks. They partition the data into subsets based on the values of features, leading to a tree-like structure.

### 7. Naive Bayes Classifier
Naive Bayes is a probabilistic classification algorithm based on Bayes' theorem. It's simple, efficient, and performs well in text classification and sentiment analysis tasks.
